## Info
[ColorSpark](https://colorspark.app) is a simple web tool I created that generates random colors and gradients to help designers discover
colors they may not otherwise think to use. This plugin for Sketch follows the same concept, but now allows designers to generate colors directly in the project they are working on.

Please feel free to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or problems.
